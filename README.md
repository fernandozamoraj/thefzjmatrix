# thefzjmatrix
The Fzj Matrix is an executable that can run as a screen save a la matrix style.

If all you need is the installation files you can download them from here

[MatrixSetup.msi](https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/thefzjmatrix/blob/master/MatrixSetup.msi)
[setup.exe](https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/thefzjmatrix/blob/master/setup.exe)

This repository contains all the code to build the application.  It was written with an older version of Visual Studio 2003 I believe. So you may have to migrate the code to the latest version of Visual Studio.

It behaves very similar to the screens that cypher and tank monitored.

It works o Windows XP, Windows 7 and 10.  I don't know if it works on windows 8 but I imagine that it would.

I don't own the license to the matrix font but you can download it for your own private use from [http://www.fontspace.com/norfok-incredible-font-design/matrix-code-nfi](http://www.fontspace.com/norfok-incredible-font-design/matrix-code-nfi)

Once you download the font you can set your screen saver settings to use that font.
