The Fzj Matrix is a screen saver for Windows (XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10).

If all you need is the installation file you can download the appropriate one from one of the links below.

[MatrixSetup.msi](https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/thefzjmatrix/blob/master/MatrixSetup.msi)
[setup.exe](https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/thefzjmatrix/blob/master/setup.exe)

Check out the page at [github.io](https://fernandozamoraj.github.io/thefzjmatrix/)

This repository contains all the code to build the application.  It was written with an older version of Visual Studio 2003 I believe. So you may have to migrate the code to the latest version of Visual Studio.

It behaves very similar to the screens that cypher and tank monitored in the movie.

It works o Windows XP, Windows 7 and 10.  I don't know if it works on windows 8 but I imagine that it would.

I don't own the license to the matrix font but you can download it for your own private use from [http://www.fontspace.com/norfok-incredible-font-design/matrix-code-nfi](http://www.fontspace.com/norfok-incredible-font-design/matrix-code-nfi)

Once you download the font you can set your screen saver settings to use that font.
