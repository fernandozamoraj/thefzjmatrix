# thefzjmatrix
The Fzj Matrix is an executable that can run as a screen save a la matrix style.

This repository contains all the code to build the application.  It was written with an older version of Visual Studio 2003 I believe. So you may have to migrate the code to the latest version of Visual Studio.

It behaves very similar to the screens that cypher and tank monitored.

It works o Windows XP, Windows 7 and 10.  I don't know if it works on windows 8 but I imagine that it would.
